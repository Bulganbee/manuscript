<h2>About the project:</h2>
<p>
 The Manuscript project challenges students to create a web page using a design reading and a written response to the reading. This project requires students to use basic HTML and CSS codes in combination with typography knowledge.

  <li>How to set up Github, VSCodium, and Live Server</li>
  <li>HTML basics, such as elements and structuring </li>

</ul>
<h2>About the reading</h2>
<p>I chose a section of a chapter from <em>Design and Crime And Other Diatribes</em> by Hal Foster. The reading intrigued me because of my interest in the Art Deco era.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Bee! I am a graduate student at MPS Communication Design at Parsons. This is my first time using HTML and CSS to code a webpage. Additionally, I have never worked on a project that focused solely on typography, so this is my introduction to type.</p>
